 *
 *  - [OnboardingUiState]   — the single source of truth for the screen, exposed
 *                           as `StateFlow` by the ViewModel
 *  - [OnboardingUiIntent]  — the set of user actions the screen can dispatch
 *  - [OnboardingUiEffect]  — one-shot events the screen should react to
 *                           (navigation, snackbar, …). Emitted via
 *                           `SharedFlow` by the ViewModel.
 *
 * The ViewModel is responsible for translating intents into state changes
 * and effect emissions; the UI is responsible for collecting state and
 * effects and rendering the corresponding UI.
